* How to play

Arrow keys: controls the angle and shooting power
Space bar: shoot

You have a cannon that shoots bouncy projectiles. Your goal is to hit the projectile on the two opposing walls (to the right and left of the screen). Each time you achieve this you will advance a level and will not lose the projectile.
You should avoid hitting obstacles. If this occurs 
you will remain at the same level and you will 
lose a projectile. If you run out of ammunition and a collision occurs, it's "GAME OVER"!       It will be victorious who can get through all 10 levels before the ammo ends.
