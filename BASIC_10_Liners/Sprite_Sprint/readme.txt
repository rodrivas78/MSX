Game Instructions:
------------------

This is a car race game where time is at stake. In other words, the best 
score goes to whoever completes the course in the shortest time!
Control the acceleration and avoid leaving the track (or even touching 
the edges!) as this will cause your car to run aground and thus,
 lose speed. If this happens, don't despair! Just keep accelerating (in 
the opposite direction of grass) until the car is free of mud!


Controls:
---------

Keyboard:
  - ARROWS (LEFT and RIGHT): steering wheel  
  - SPACEBAR (ACCELERATOR): gas pedal

Tips:
 ----
  - Increase the volume (the game has some sounds).


Emulation:
---------
The game should work well on almost any MSX emulator, but I 
would like recommend BlueMSX or openMSX.

Load Instructions:
1. Start BlueMSX .
2. Drag & drop disk image "Sprite_Sprint.dsk" to the BlueMSX main window.
3. Press "play" button (little arow on the top) or  LAlt+F9
4. The game will start automatically
